    Description:
</h4>
<p>
    For this laboratory you will have to:
    <br>
    1) Download the index.html that has been provided in this laboratory in the google site.
    <br>
    2) Using JavaScript add an event listener to the “Add Item” button. This event should pick up
    the value that the user types in the text input and it should generate a li element that
    you must add to the ul located in the index.html. The just created li element should
    have the name of the item and two buttons. Just as shown in the following image:
    <br>
    3) Using JavaScript you will keep on adding event listeners for the “Check” and “Delete”
    buttons of the created items. These event listeners should work for all items that the user
    might want to add to the list.
    a. When clicking the “Check” button you will have to cross the text in the li of the
    clicked item. If the user clicks it again the crossed line must go away as if the item
    has not been checked. If the user keeps clicking the “Check” button the same
    functionality should be replicated. The following image represents how the text is
    crossed when the user clicks in the “Check” button.
    The “Delete” button will remove the current li element from the list when it is
    clicked.
    <br>
    4) Feel free to add any CSS to this laboratory, be creative! You may also add classes or ids to
    the elements provided in the html.
    <br>
    5) Once you finish with the development you will have to add this laboratory to your github
    under a new repository. Generate the Github pages link to get the live version. Both links to
    this repository and github pages must be added as a comment or in the edit text box of a
    new page that you will have to create under your profile.
